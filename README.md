## 🧑‍💻 About me:

My name is Constantine Artemiou **[<a href = "" target = "_blank" rel = "noreferrer">ConstArt<a>]**. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus in Athens, **Greece**.

🩷 I **love** exploring new ideas about **Computers** & **Mathematics**, as well as their direct applications in the field of aesthetics & everyday life!

🏗️ I am also incredibly attracted to the field of **construction**, the main one being the engineering of **Robotic Systems**, and programming them to achieve ambitious results-functions!

💡 Outside of my main field of work, I have several interests, such as **poetry**, **philosophy**, **music** & **geometry**. I strongly believe how it is incredibly important for a person to have several activities, as they make him a **multi-dimensional** personality, capable of contributing in numerous areas of the **intellectual** world.
