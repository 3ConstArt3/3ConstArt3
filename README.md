I'm Constantine Artemiou [<a href = "" target = "_blank" rel = "noreferrer">ConstArt<a>].

<h2 align = "center">
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus.

I love exploring new ideas about computers and mathematics🔢, and how they can be applied in a highly aesthetic way! I am also incredibly attracted to the field of construction, the main one being the engineering of robotic systems🤖, and programming them to achieve ambitious results-functions!<h2>
