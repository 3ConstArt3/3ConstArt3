## 📝 About me:

🎓 My name is Constantine Artemiou [**<a href = "">ConstArt<a>**]. I'm an undergraduate student at the **University of Piraeus** in Athens, **Greece**.

🧑‍💻 I **love** exploring new ideas about **Computers** & **Mathematics**, as well as their direct applications in the field of aesthetics & everyday life! I've discovered some really amazing things in these fields, especially in the sector of **Fractals**.

🏗️ I am also incredibly attracted to the **construction** sector. My involvement with **puzzles** & **lego** parts since I was a kid, led me to discover one of my main interests, which is the engineering of **robotic systems**, as well as programming them to achieve ambitious results-functions (in terms of **code**!).

💡 Outside of my main field of work, I have several interests, such as **Poetry**, **Philosophy**, **Music** & **Geometry**. I strongly believe how it is incredibly important for a person to have several activities to keep himself engaged, as they make him a **multi-dimensional** personality, capable of contributing in numerous areas of the **intellectual** world.
